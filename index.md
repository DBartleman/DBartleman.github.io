## About Me

  I'm a software developer with a focus in design and a passion for user experience. When I'm not improving the layout or flow of a project, I'm listening to music or doing some metalworking. I believe iteration is one of the most practical and effective ways to learn, and I carry that principle through my work and hobbies. I've recently worked on several projects to hone my skills in javascript, python, and the react framework.

## Projects

[SoundSpace is a music discovery and playback site]() SoundSpace is currently in development, and as such, many aspects about the app are unfinished and hard to write about. Check back later! [[source]](https://github.com/DBartleman/SoundSpace-frontend)

[Flashnerd is a flashcard and study aid site](https://flashnerd.herokuapp.com/) that allows users to create flash cards and study from them, featuring card animations, sorting of cards into different decks, and marking cards or decks as complete. It was built on React using Redux for state management and python for the backend. [[source]](https://github.com/SauceKnight/frontend_flashcard)

[videoEats is a restaurant video review site](https://video-eats-client.herokuapp.com/) where users can review restaurants in the San Francisco area by posting their youtube-hosted video reviews or text reviews along with a star-based rating. Review scores are aggregated and displayed on a google map that shows searched locations as pins. It was built with node connected to an express backend.
